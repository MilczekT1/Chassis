# 1. Record architecture decisions

Date: 2025-01-14

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records,
as [described by Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions). With the
exception of using 1st person as there is only one developer.

## Consequences

See Michael Nygard's article, linked above. For a lightweight ADR toolset, see Nat
Pryce's [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools).
